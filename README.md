# Trellio

Trellio is a simple Sinatra app that hooks up Twilio with Trello to record and
transcribe voicemails to cards on a Trello board.

## Features

* Posts voicemail recording to Trello card
* Posts voicemail transcription to Trello card
* Play a custom voicemail message
* Blacklist that directs unwanted calls straight to voicemail

## Blacklist

To access the blacklist, navigate to `http://YOURSERVER/blacklists` in the browser.

## Dependencies

* MongoDB

## Setup

```bash
$ brew install mongodb
$ bundle
```

### Settings

Settings are managed via environment variables:

* `FORWARD_NUMBER` The phone number to attempt to forward calls to
* `RING_TIMEOUT` Number of seconds to ring before going to voicemail
* `MESSAGE_URL` URL to an audio file to playback as voicemail message
* `RECORD_TIMEOUT` Max number of seconds for caller's recorded message

### Trello Integration

1. Grab the ID of the Trello board you'd like to use and set to ENV var
   `TRELLO_BOARD_ID`
1. Get a Trello developer key here: https://trello.com/1/appKey/generate
1. Set that as ENV var `TRELLO_DEVELOPER_PUBLIC_KEY`
1. Run the Sinatra app: `$ ruby app.rb`
1. Navigate to "/authorize_trello" and follow the instructions there

### Twilio Integration

1. Setup the "Voice Request URL" for your number to send a `POST` to "/incoming"

### Run the app

```bash
$ ruby app.rb
```

## Known Issues

* For very short messages that are transcribed quickly, we can end up with two
  cards in Trello: one for the recording and another for the transcription. Need
  to use some form of blocking queue for each Message to prevent this race
  condition.

This app was developed during my open source time at philosophie and currently
powers our company voicemail.
